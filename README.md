Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
  
   Google Data Analytics Course capstone project: case study on Cylclistic bike share.The main objective to Design marketing strategies aimed at **converting casual riders into annual members**. For better understanding of casual and annual memebers, customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. To be specific, a sucessful bike sharing company desires to increase the number of their annual memberships.

  As i learned from the Google Data Analytics Program, I will follow the steps of data analysis: **Ask,Prepare,Process,Analyze,Share and Act**. However,since Act step is for executives to decide, i will not cover that step here. I used **R** programming to solve the case study.
