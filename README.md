Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
  
   Google Data Analytics Course capstone project: case study on Cylclistic bike share.The main objective to Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.For better understanding of casual and annual memebers, customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. To be specific, a sucessful bike sharing company desires to increase the number of their annual memberships.

  As i learned from the Google Data Analytics Program, I will follow the steps of data analysis: **Ask,Prepare,Process,Analyze,Share and Act**. However,since Act step is for executives to decide, i will not cover that step here. I used **R** programming to solve the case study.
